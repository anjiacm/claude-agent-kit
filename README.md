# Claude Agent Kit

[English](README.md) | [中文](README_CN.md)

> Turn Claude Code into autonomous, self-healing, multi-worker super agents.

Claude Agent Kit is a **meta-framework** for building production-grade AI agents on top of [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). It's not another chatbot wrapper — it's the infrastructure that lets Claude manage servers, operate phones, monitor security, and run 24/7 with zero human babysitting.

**One command. One framework. Infinite agents.**

```bash
bash create-agent.sh
```

*Central AI brain coordinating multiple server racks through parallel workers — the core concept of Claude Agent Kit*

---

## What Makes This Different

Claude Code is powerful, but out of the box it's **stateless** — it forgets everything when context compresses, can't run background tasks, and has no way to coordinate multiple workers. Claude Agent Kit solves all of this:

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Context compression kills workers | **Centralized State Protocol** — heartbeat registry + precise recovery |
| No background monitoring | **Plugin Daemons** — nohup processes independent of Claude's lifecycle |
| No visual feedback | **Pixel-art Dashboard** — isometric server rack UI with WebSocket real-time updates |
| No multi-agent coordination | **Team Mode** — Lead dispatches, Workers execute in parallel |
| Knowledge lost between sessions | **Memory System** — per-entity Markdown files + cross-entity knowledge base |
| No self-improvement | **Self-Learning Loop** — auto-discovers knowledge gaps, studies, and integrates findings |

---

## Production-Proven Agents

These agents run daily in production, built entirely with this framework:

### Server Maintenance Agent

**12 servers. 4 workers. 10+ monitoring tasks. Fully autonomous.**

- Manages 7 production servers across 3 countries via SSH
- 4 parallel Workers handle health checks, deployments, log analysis, Nginx/SSL management
- Cloudflare WAF monitoring catches carding bots, blocks malicious ASNs
- Performance/SEO/SSL/Database/Docker/Security audits run on independent schedules
- Feishu (Lark) bot integration for real-time alerts and bidirectional commands
- Self-learning system discovers knowledge gaps and studies them during idle time

![Architecture](docs/images/architecture-diagram.png)
*Express Server hub connecting Dashboard, Claude Code, Team Workers, and Plugin Daemons*

**Key stats:**
- 15+ custom Skills (health-check, deploy, nginx-ssl, monitor-cloudflare, backup-check...)
- 10 monitoring sub-tasks via unified daemon (CF/Perf/SSL/SEO/ERP/IoT/Health/Backup/DB/Docker/Security)
- Context compression recovery in < 5 seconds (zero worker loss)
- 30+ REST API endpoints for Dashboard communication

### Android Content Creator Agent

**Autonomous Xiaohongshu (RED) tech blogger. Researches, writes, generates images, posts — all by itself.**

- Controls a physical Android phone via ADB (tap, type, swipe, screenshot)
- Researches trending tech topics via Chrome browser + WebSearch
- Writes Xiaohongshu-style copy (short sentences, emotional hooks, <=18 char titles)
- Generates cover images with Gemini 3.1 Flash Image API
- Posts to Xiaohongshu automatically (navigate UI, select photos, input text, publish)
- Time-aware decision engine: research in morning, post during peak hours, engage at night
- "Three-Think" system: pre-checks every action against 15 learned lessons to avoid mistakes

**Key stats:**
- 25+ posts published autonomously
- 2 Workers (researcher-writer + poster)
- 3 CronCreate heartbeats driving the self-operating cycle
- Compliance guardrails prevent AI-automation disclosure (platform policy)

## Architecture

    └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Centralized State Protocol

The core innovation that makes multi-worker agents reliable:

```
Worker Lifecycle:  online → busy → progress → idle → error
                     ↑                                  │
                     └──────── spawn recovery ←─────────┘
```

- **Heartbeat Registry**: Workers report alive status; 30-minute stale threshold
- **State Ledger**: Workers report lifecycle changes; Lead "reads the ledger" for decisions
- **Precise Recovery**: After context compression, stop-check.sh pings each worker individually — only respawns confirmed dead ones, never blindly rebuilds
- **Deregister API**: Properly shutdown workers are removed from tracking, preventing "zombie alive" bugs

### Self-Healing Flow

```
Context Compression Happens
  ↓
stop-check.sh (Hook) triggers automatically
  ↓
Read worker-ids.json → Query /api/team/health → Read state ledger
  ↓
Per-worker decision:
  busy < 30min  → skip (protecting active work)
  pong received → refresh heartbeat
  no response   → spawn replacement → update IDs
  ↓
Full recovery in seconds. Zero task loss.
```

## 7 Primitives

| # | Primitive | What It Does | Directory |
|---|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | **Agent Definition** | Role, startup sequence, safety rules, skill mapping | `CLAUDE.md` |
| 2 | **Dashboard** | Express+WebSocket server + Isometric pixel-art Canvas UI | `web/` |
| 3 | **Skills** | On-demand capabilities (stateless, user-triggered) | `skills/` |
| 4 | **Plugins** | Background daemons (stateful, independent of Claude) | `plugins/` |
| 5 | **Memory** | Per-entity Markdown knowledge + cross-entity knowledge base | `memory/` |
| 6 | **Hooks** | Session lifecycle automation (start/stop/prompt/compact) | `.claude/hooks/` |
| 7 | **Config** | `.env` secrets + `entities.yaml` entity catalog | root |

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the framework
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-kit.git
cd claude-agent-kit

# 2. Create your agent project (interactive wizard)
bash create-agent.sh

# ✅ Project name?          → my-ops-agent
# ✅ Agent role?             → 本地服务器运维助手
# ✅ Entity type?            → server (ssh/api/local)
# ✅ Dashboard port?         → 7890
# ✅ Team workers?           → 4
# ✅ Feishu integration?     → y/n
# ✅ Webhook notifications?  → y/n

# 3. Enter your project
cd ~/Documents/code/my-ops-agent

# 4. Configure
cp .env.example .env        # Fill in your API keys
vim entities.yaml           # Add your servers/devices/targets

# 5. Install
bash setup.sh               # Symlink skills, hooks, sync memory

# 6. Launch Claude Code in the project directory
# → Dashboard auto-starts
# → Workers auto-spawn
# → Monitoring daemons auto-launch
# → Ready for commands
```

## Team Mode

Lead-Worker architecture for parallel execution:

```
Poll discovers message → Lead parses → SendMessage to Worker (< 1 sec) → Resume polling
                                              ↓
                                   Worker executes independently
                                              ↓
                                   Worker reports back to Lead
                                              ↓
                                   Lead summarizes to user
```

**Key rules (battle-tested):**
- Lead **only dispatches**, never executes Skills/SSH directly
- All tasks go to Workers, including research and file exploration
- Same entity → same Worker (memory file safety)
- Dispatch immediately, don't wait for Worker completion
- Worker prompts built from `memory/worker-base-prompt.md` template (consistency guaranteed)

## Skill vs Plugin

| | **Skill** | **Plugin** |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger | User command / Dashboard click | Timer / Event-driven |
| Lifecycle | Stateless, runs and exits | Persistent daemon (nohup) |
| Process Tree | Inside Claude context | Independent of Claude |
| Communication | Direct execution + curl Dashboard | POST /api/messages to queue |
| Survives Context Compression | No | Yes |
| Example | `deploy-project`, `health-check` | `cf-monitor`, `feishu-bot` |

### Create a Skill

```
skills/my-skill/
└── SKILL.md    # Trigger conditions, steps, output format
```

### Create a Plugin

```
plugins/my-plugin/
├── PLUGIN.md   # Manifest (name, interval, pid_file)
├── daemon.sh   # Main loop with PID management
└── start.sh    # Startup script
```

---

## Dashboard API

Core endpoints (full reference in `docs/dashboard-api.md`):

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/health` | GET | Health check |
| `/api/server/init` | POST | Initialize entity list |
| `/api/server/:alias/status` | POST | Update entity metrics |
| `/api/worker/spawn` | POST | Dispatch pixel worker |
| `/api/worker/:id/term` | POST | Terminal output |
| `/api/worker/:id/done` | POST | Mark complete |
| `/api/messages` | GET | Consume message queue |
| `/api/messages` | POST | Inject message (plugins) |
| `/api/team/heartbeat` | POST | Worker heartbeat |
| `/api/team/health` | GET | Worker health status |
| `/api/team/deregister` | POST | Remove shutdown worker |
| `/api/worker/state` | POST | Worker lifecycle report |
| `/api/worker/states` | GET | Read state ledger |

---

## Built-in Plugins

| Plugin | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `feishu-notify` | listener | Feishu/Lark WebSocket bot + reply + Bitable reports |
| `webhook-notify` | utility | Universal webhook (Feishu group/Slack/Discord/HTTP) |

---

## Self-Learning System

Agents don't just execute — they **learn and improve**:

```
Hook detects unknown concept → /intent-check validates understanding
                                        ↓
                              Knowledge gap found → learning-queue.md
                                        ↓
                              Worker idle → /self-study triggered
                                        ↓
                              Research → Verify → Reflect → Report
                                        ↓
                              memory/knowledge/*.md updated
                                        ↓
                              Next encounter → already knows
```

- **Intent Check**: Before implementing unfamiliar concepts, verify understanding first
- **Learning Queue**: Knowledge gaps are tracked with priority and status
- **Self-Study Skill**: Idle workers autonomously pick topics, research, and integrate findings
- **Knowledge Base**: `memory/knowledge/` accumulates cross-entity domain expertise

## Proven Patterns & Anti-Patterns

Extracted from months of production operation (full list in `docs/proven-patterns.md`):

| Pattern | Status | Lesson |
|---------|:------:|--------|
| Process message → restart poll immediately | Correct | Forgetting = Claude goes deaf |
| nohup daemon + PID + trap EXIT | Correct | Survives context compression |
| Dual-channel notifications (queue + push) | Correct | Missing either = invisible daemon |
| Lead only dispatches, never executes | Correct | Executing blocks polling |
| Reuse idle Workers for all tasks | Correct | Don't spawn new agents when Workers are free |
| Blind proxy heartbeat for all workers | **Wrong** | Resurrects properly shutdown workers |
| `alive=N` → skip recovery | **Wrong** | Shutdown worker stays "alive" forever |
| Lead runs SSH directly | **Wrong** | Workers sit idle, Lead blocked |

## FAQ

**Q: Is this just prompt engineering?**
A: No. It's infrastructure — Express servers, WebSocket communication, background daemons, hook-based lifecycle management, and a centralized state protocol. The prompts (CLAUDE.md) define *what* the agent does; the framework provides *how* it stays alive and coordinates.

**Q: Does it work with models other than Claude?**
A: Currently designed for Claude Code specifically. The hook system, TeamCreate/SendMessage, and Agent spawning are Claude Code features. The Dashboard server and Plugin daemons are model-agnostic.

**Q: How many workers can it handle?**
A: Tested with 2-8 workers. The centralized state protocol scales linearly. The practical limit is Claude Code's context window and your machine's process capacity.

**Q: What happens when context compresses?**
A: The self-healing system kicks in automatically via stop-check.sh. Worker IDs are persisted to disk, health is checked via REST API, and only confirmed-dead workers are respawned. Typical recovery time: < 5 seconds.
